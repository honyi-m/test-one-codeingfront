                <b>Turkiye</b>
                <p>-I have traveled to <strong>Turkey</strong> and it was a truly unforgettable experience. 
                This beautiful country is full of amazing places to visit, from incredible historical monuments 
                to breathtaking natural landscapes. The <b>food</b> is truly amazing – every meal was a feast of flavors and I
                 enjoyed every bite. I truly love this country and it holds a special place in my heart.
                On this trip, I also went to <strong>Istanbul</strong>, a city that is alive and well even at night, and I love its energetic 
                atmosphere and lively nightlife.
                The country has very kind and hospitable people who made the trip even more enjoyable.
                What makes this trip even more special for me is that I can speak <i>Istanbul Turkish</i> fluently and even teach it to others. 
                Traveling to Turkey was not just a trip, but a deep connection with a culture that I admire so much.
                Now I want to introduce you to some of the country's popular sights and foods.</p>

                <b>Tabriz</b>

                    I am a Turk myself and I am always proud of my city. Tabriz is a historical and cultural city in the northwest 
                    of Iran that is full of interesting and fascinating places. From the Grand Bazaar of Tabriz, which is one of the oldest
                    covered markets in the world, to the Blue Mosque with its unique tilework, every corner of the city is full of stories 
                    and history.
                    The cuisine of Tabriz is both famous and well-known; Tabrizi meatballs, dolma, doogh soup and sweets such as baghlama, 
                    each of which has a special and hearty taste and turns every meal into a celebration. The Azerbaijani Turkish language 
                    spoken in this city is an inseparable part of the people's identity and has shaped the rich culture, local music and 
                    customs of the Tabrizis.
                    Tabriz is a vibrant city that both holds history in its heart and experiences modern life. 
                    The kind and hospitable people of this city make a trip to Tabriz memorable for every tourist.
                    I always like to introduce the culture and beauty of Tabriz to others and I hope that one day you will see this
                    beautiful city and fall in love with it.

             <b>Isfahan</b>
            <p>I have traveled to Isfahan and it was truly an unforgettable experience. This historic city with its magnificent architecture 
                and beautiful bridges such as Si-Vose-Pol and Khaju-Pol, fascinates every visitor. Naqsh-e-Jahan Square with its 
                surrounding mosques and palaces such as Imam Mosque and Ali-Qapu is a symbol of Iranian culture and art, where history
                can be felt in every corner.
                The food of Isfahan is also very delicious and diverse; dishes such as Isfahan biryani, Sultani kebab and local stews,
                 each of which has a special and pleasant taste and makes the trip more enjoyable. The culture and art of this city are 
                 also clearly visible in the music, handicrafts such as khatam kari and carpet weaving.
                Isfahan is a city that beautifully blends history and modern life, and its kind and hospitable people made my trip to this 
                city a memorable one. I hope everyone can visit this beautiful city one day and enjoy its beauty.
                Now I want to introduce you to some of the popular sights and foods of this country.</p>
